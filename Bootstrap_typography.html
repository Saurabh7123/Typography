    <pre>
        I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
        And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;
        Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,
        And live alone in the bee-loud glade.
        
        And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
        Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;
        There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
        And evening full of the linnet’s wings.
        
        I will arise and go now, for always night and day
        I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
        While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,
        I hear it in the deep heart’s core.
    </pre>
